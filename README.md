# FerasAPP

FerasAPP is the application I developed for my final year project (Skripsi) in Indonesia. The application, named FERAS (Face Recognition Attendance System), is designed to streamline attendance tracking using facial recognition technology.

## Process of Creation

### 1. Face Detection with TensorFlow CNN
In this phase, I developed a face detection model using TensorFlow's Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). I collected facial samples from six of my friends, who were designated as employees in the FERAS system.

### 2. Testing
Once the model was created, it underwent testing to evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness in recognizing and predicting employee faces.

### 3. Application Development
For the application development, I used React.js, Express.js, and Flask, integrating these technologies to ensure smooth and efficient operation.

## Results
